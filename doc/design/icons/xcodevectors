## How Vectors Work in Xcode 7

Instead of scaling vectors at run time, the Xcode system takes your PDF image and generates @1x PNG, @2x PNG, and @3x PNG assets at build time.

When you run the app, iOS automatically picks the size of the icon depending on the device.

## Why Vectors Work This Way in Xcode 7

- Backwards compatible with previous iOS versions

- No performance hits. By comparison, resizing vectors may be a computationally intensive task at run time

## Why Use Vectors if We End up Having PNGs

- To save time creating image assets (unless you have a tool that already does it for you)

- Fewer files to maintain

- Future proof support (e.g. if in iOS 15 Apple begins to require @4x assets)


## Embedding Vectos in Xcode 7

1. Generate PDFs With @1x Asset

2. Drag into Xcode

3. Set the Scale Factors to Single Vector
