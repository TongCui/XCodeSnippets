It is a term used in **dynamic languages** that do not have **strong typing**.

The idea is that you don't need a type in order to invoke an existing method on an object - if a method is defined on it, you can invoke it.

The name comes from the phrase "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck".
