  /** ... */  for multi-line comments
  ///         for single-line comment

- Unordered lists can use a variety of bullet characters: -, +, *, â€¢

- Ordered lists use Arabic numerals (1,2,3...) followed by a period 1. or right parenthesis 1)

- Headers can be marked with preceding # signs or by underlining with = or -.

- Even links and images work, with web-based images pulled down and displayed directly in Xcode.

/**
    # Lists

    You can apply *italic*, **bold**, or `code` inline styles.

    ## Unordered Lists

    - Lists are great,
    - but perhaps don't nest
    - Sub-list formatting

      - isn't the best.

    ## Ordered Lists

    1. Ordered lists, too
    2. for things that are sorted;
    3. Arabic numerals
    4. are the only kind supported.
