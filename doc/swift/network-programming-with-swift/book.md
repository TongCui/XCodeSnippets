## 1. Introduction to Swift

Some of the benefits of Swift are

• It is fast and powerful.

• Variables are always initialized before usage.

• Arrays are checked for overflow.

• Memory management is automatic.

• Less coding is needed to accomplish equivalent Objective-C tasks.

• It includes interactive playgrounds

• No more semicolons are necessary (my favorite).
